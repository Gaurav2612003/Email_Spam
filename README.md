Built a binary text classification model to detect spam emails using NLP and machine learning techniques.

Preprocessed raw emails with tokenization, stopword removal, punctuation stripping, and stemming for cleaner feature extraction.

Transformed text using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer; selected CountVectorizer with RandomOverSampler to address class imbalance.

Achieved high accuracy and precision using Multinomial Naive Bayes, validated on stratified test and validation sets.

Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix; implemented real-time prediction for custom inputs.
